    <b>India One:</b> Club the top 2-tiers above and you find that the top 15% of Indians, i.e. about
    150-180 million, earning an average of Rs 30,000 per month, are the ones who have money
    left over after buying necessities. These 15% of Indians control over half the spending power
    of the economy and almost its entire discretionary spending. They consume their data plans
    without thinking about the bills. They install the shiny new apps without bothering about the
    gigabytes they consume on their oversized and expensive smartphones. They have Wi-Fi at home
    and office, power generators at home and are connected 24x7.
    </p>
    <p>
    Threpresents. That’s the money that trickles down to them.
    </p>
    <p>
    They have managed to change their fate and climbed out of poverty over the last two decades by
    migrating from their tiny bits of un-arable land to the mega cities of India and taken up jobs
    to serve the needs of these markets. They work two shifts as Uber/Ola drivers or as cooks in
    our burgeoning restaurant chains, or set up small businesses—and send money back home to their
    families in the villages.
  ey are equivalent to a country with the population of Canada and live the lifestyle of a
    European nation (if you equate them on purchasing power parity, or PPP basis)—and with better
    lifestyle to boot. They have chauffeurs, maids, cooks, cleaners, peons to take care of onerous
    chores. And no, they won’t step out of their air-conditioned homes into our dirty streets and
    traffic—everything has to be served instantly, at home. Assisted living at the age of 20,
    I call it.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>India Two:</b> This is the middle 30% or 400-odd million Indians, earning an average of Rs 7,000
    a month. This would be a country about three times the size of Bangladesh with a similar level of
    purchasing power.
    </p>
    <p>
    They are the ones who “service” the $1 trillion market (yes, read that again) that India One
      </p>
    <p>
    Luckily for us, they still see hard work, family values and education as a ticket to a better
    future. Most save all their money to get their kids an education. You see them break through
    the barriers every day. Most of their income is spent on food and rent, and whatever little is
    left they use to try and escape from life in their smartphone screens by buying movies or songs
    on an SD card from the neighbourhood store. They buy second-hand smartphones and tiny sub-hundred
    rupee data packs to keep in touch. Of course, we report them as internet consumers in our slick
    presentations on Startup India.
    </p>
    <p>
    <b>India Three:</b> These are the forgotten 650 million who subsist and don’t have the money to buy
    two square meals. Their incomes rival that of sub-Saharan Africa. They are the ones who did not
    leave our road-less, school-less, toilet-less, and power-less villages and instead chose to send
    a child or a sibling to work in the big cities. They live on the mercy of our monsoons and whatever
    little reaches them through our poverty alleviation programmes. They live on the periphery of our
    economy and for all practical purposes don’t participate in it. However, they are the ones who
    form our vote banks and determine the political future of our nation.
