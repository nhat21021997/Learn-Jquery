            <b>India One:</b> Club the top 2-tiers above and you find that the top 15% of Indians, i.e. about
            150-180 million, earning an average of Rs 30,000 per month, are the ones who have money
            left over after buying necessities. These 15% of Indians control over half the spending power
            of the economy and almost its entire discretionary spending. They consume their data plans
            without thinking about the bills. They install the shiny new apps without bothering about the
            gigabytes they consume on their oversized and expensive smartphones. They have Wi-Fi at home
            and office, power generators at home and are connected 24x7.
        </p>
        <p>
            They are equivalent to a country with the population of Canada and live the lifestyle of a
            European nation (if you equate them on purchasing power parity, or PPP basis)—and with better
            lifestyle to boot. They have chauffeurs, maids, cooks, cleaners, peons to take care of onerous
            chores. And no, they won’t step out of their air-conditioned homes into our dirty streets and
            traffic—everything has to be served instantly, at home. Assisted living at the age of 20,
            I call it.

            <b>India Two:</b> This is the middle 30% or 400-odd million Indians, earning an average of Rs 7,000
            a month. This would be a country about three times the size of Bangladesh with a similar level of
            purchasing power.
        </p>
        <p>
            They are the ones who “service” the $1 trillion market (yes, read that again) that India One
            represents. That’s the money that trickles down to them.
